# SQLite3 Database Internal Structure Analysis using XXD

## Objective

The objective of this experiment was to analyze the internal physical structure of a SQLite3 database file using hexadecimal dumps generated through the `xxd` utility.

The experiment demonstrates how SQLite internally stores:

- SQLite database headers
- B-tree pages
- Table metadata
- Cell pointer arrays
- Record payloads
- Root page references
- Table records
- Internal schema definitions

A custom SQLite database named `lab.db` was created and inspected at the binary level using real hexadecimal dumps.

---

# Database Creation

The database was created using SQLite3.

## Schema Used

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    age INTEGER,
    dept TEXT
);
```

The schema was verified using:

```sql
.schema students
```

---

# Records Inserted

The table contains 10 student records.

## Table Contents

| ID | Name    | Age | Department |
|----|----------|-----|------------|
| 1  | Alice    | 20  | CSE        |
| 2  | Bob      | 21  | ECE        |
| 3  | Charlie  | 22  | MECH       |
| 4  | David    | 20  | EEE        |
| 5  | Eva      | 23  | CIVIL      |
| 6  | Frank    | 24  | CSE        |
| 7  | Grace    | 21  | ECE        |
| 8  | Helen    | 22  | MECH       |
| 9  | Ian      | 20  | EEE        |
| 10 | Jane     | 23  | CIVIL      |

Verified using:

```sql
SELECT * FROM students;
```

---

# SQLite Database Metadata

The following commands were executed:

```sql
PRAGMA page_size;
PRAGMA page_count;

SELECT rootpage, sql
FROM sqlite_master
WHERE type='table';
```

---

# Metadata Output

```text
Page Size  : 4096 bytes
Page Count : 2
```

The `students` table root page:

| Table Name | Root Page |
|------------|-----------|
| students   | 2         |

---

# Physical File Layout

Since each SQLite page is 4096 bytes:

| Page Number | Offset Range |
|-------------|--------------|
| Page 1 | 0x0000 – 0x0FFF |
| Page 2 | 0x1000 – 0x1FFF |

---

# SQLite File Header Analysis

The database file was inspected using:

```bash
xxd -g 1 lab.db
```

Beginning of the dump:

```text
00000000: 53 51 4c 69 74 65 20 66 6f 72 6d 61 74 20 33 00
```

---

# ASCII Decoding

The hexadecimal bytes decode to:

```text
SQLite format 3
```

This is the official SQLite database file signature.

---

# SQLite Header Breakdown

| Hex Bytes | Meaning |
|------------|----------|
| 53 51 4C 69 | SQLi |
| 74 65 | te |
| 20 66 6F 72 6D 61 74 | format |
| 20 33 00 | 3 |

---

# Page Size Analysis

Bytes at offset `0x10`:

```text
10 00
```

Hexadecimal conversion:

```text
0x1000 = 4096
```

This confirms that each SQLite database page occupies 4096 bytes.

This matches the SQL output from:

```sql
PRAGMA page_size;
```

---

# SQLite Internal B-Tree Structure

SQLite internally stores all data using B-tree pages.

The database contains:

| Page | Type | Purpose |
|------|------|----------|
| 1 | Table B-tree | sqlite_master metadata |
| 2 | Leaf Table B-tree | students table |

---

# Overall Database Layout

```text
lab.db
│
├── Page 1 (0x0000 – 0x0FFF)
│     ├── SQLite File Header
│     ├── sqlite_master B-tree
│     ├── Schema Metadata
│     └── CREATE TABLE statement
│
└── Page 2 (0x1000 – 0x1FFF)
      ├── students Table B-tree
      ├── Cell Pointer Array
      └── Student Records
```

---

# Analysis of Page 1 (sqlite_master)

At offset `0x0000`, the SQLite database header is stored.

At offset `0x0060`, the sqlite_master B-tree page begins:

```text
00000060: 00 2e 76 89 0d 00 00 00 01 0f 7d 00
```

---

# Decoding the sqlite_master Page Header

Important bytes:

```text
0d 00 00 00 01 0f 7d 00
```

| Bytes | Meaning |
|--------|----------|
| 0d | Leaf Table B-tree Page |
| 00 00 | No freeblocks |
| 00 01 | 1 cell |
| 0f 7d | Cell content begins at offset 3965 |
| 00 | No fragmented bytes |

This page stores the database schema definition.

---

# CREATE TABLE Statement Stored Internally

The schema text is physically visible inside the database dump.

Visible bytes:

```text
43 52 45 41 54 45 20 54 41 42 4c 45
```

ASCII decoding:

```text
CREATE TABLE
```

Extracted schema from dump:

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    age INTEGER,
    dept TEXT
)
```

This proves that SQLite stores schema definitions physically inside the database file itself.

---

# Analysis of Page 2 (Students Table)

Page 2 begins at offset:

```text
0x1000
```

Beginning of Page 2:

```text
00001000: 0d 00 00 00 0a 0f 5f 00
```

---

# Decoding the Page Header

SQLite leaf table page header structure:

| Offset | Size | Meaning |
|--------|------|----------|
| 0 | 1 byte | Page Type |
| 1-2 | 2 bytes | First Freeblock |
| 3-4 | 2 bytes | Number of Cells |
| 5-6 | 2 bytes | Start of Cell Content |
| 7 | 1 byte | Fragmented Free Bytes |

---

# Decoded Header Values

| Bytes | Value | Meaning |
|--------|-------|----------|
| 0d | 13 | Leaf Table B-tree Page |
| 00 00 | 0 | No freeblocks |
| 00 0a | 10 | 10 table records |
| 0f 5f | 3935 | Cell content begins |
| 00 | 0 | No fragmented bytes |

This confirms that the students table contains exactly 10 records.

---

# Cell Pointer Array

Immediately after the page header:

```text
0f f0
0f e2
0f cf
0f bf
0f af
0f 9f
0f 8f
0f 7e
0f 70
0f 5f
```

These values are cell pointers.

Each pointer stores the exact location of a row record within the page.

---

# Pointer Interpretation

Example pointer:

```text
0f f0
```

Hexadecimal conversion:

```text
0x0FF0 = 4080
```

Absolute file address:

```text
4096 + 4080 = 8176
```

SQLite uses these pointers to directly locate row payloads efficiently.

---

# SQLite Page Organization

SQLite pages grow in opposite directions.

```text
+----------------------+
| B-tree Page Header   |
+----------------------+
| Cell Pointer Array   |
+----------------------+
| Free Space           |
|                      |
|                      |
+----------------------+
| Record Data          |
| (grows upward)       |
+----------------------+
```

This design minimizes memory movement during insertions.

---

# Record Payload Analysis

Student records are stored near the end of the page.

Example extracted text from dump:

```text
41 6c 69 63 65
```

ASCII:

```text
Alice
```

---

# Additional Record Examples

## Department Field

Hex:

```text
43 53 45
```

ASCII:

```text
CSE
```

---

## Another Student Record

Hex:

```text
43 68 61 72 6c 69 65
```

ASCII:

```text
Charlie
```

---

## Department Example

Hex:

```text
4d 45 43 48
```

ASCII:

```text
MECH
```

These values confirm that SQLite stores actual record payloads directly inside leaf B-tree pages.

---

# SQLite Record Format

SQLite records follow this structure:

```text
[Payload Size]
[Row ID]
[Record Header Size]
[Serial Types]
[Column Data]
```

Each row uses variable-length storage depending on data type and field size.

---

# sqlite_master Metadata

The dump contains metadata bytes:

```text
74 61 62 6c 65 73 74 75 64 65 6e 74 73
```

ASCII decoding:

```text
tablestudents
```

This confirms that SQLite stores metadata internally as ordinary records.

---

# Root Page Reference

The metadata references:

| Object | Root Page |
|--------|-----------|
| students | 2 |

This matches the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT rootpage, sql
FROM sqlite_master
WHERE type='table';
```

---

# Lookup Process in SQLite

Example query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE id = 5;
```

SQLite internally performs:

```text
Root Page
    ↓
Students Table B-tree (Page 2)
    ↓
Read Cell Pointer Array
    ↓
Locate matching row
    ↓
Read record payload
```

---

# Important Observations

1. SQLite stores all data using B-tree structures.
2. Database metadata is stored inside normal database pages.
3. Schema definitions are physically stored inside the file.
4. SQLite records are variable length.
5. Cell pointers allow fast row lookups.
6. SQLite pages grow from opposite directions.
7. The database can be completely inspected using hexadecimal tools.
8. SQLite efficiently stores both metadata and user records in a compact binary format.
9. Only two pages are required to store the schema and 10 records in this example.

---

# Conclusion

This experiment successfully demonstrated the internal physical structure of a SQLite3 database using hexadecimal dumps generated through `xxd`.

The analysis revealed:

- SQLite database headers
- Internal B-tree organization
- sqlite_master metadata storage
- Leaf table pages
- Cell pointer arrays
- Record payload structures
- Root page references
- Internal schema storage

The experiment proves that SQLite is a compact self-contained embedded database engine that stores all metadata and records using B-tree pages and variable-length binary records inside a single database file.
